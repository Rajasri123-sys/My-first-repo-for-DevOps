IP Address
Used to generate unique address to a particular device that is connected to your network.
To generate IP Address, standard we used is IPv4
Dot(.) - each of them vary from 0 to 255.
0-255*0-255*0-255*0-255
why 255 - computer understands bits.
IP Address - 4 bytes (32(4*8) bits)

Subnet:
dividing into separate sections and using
Advantage:
1. Security
2. Privacy
3. Isolation

Private subnet - does not have access to internet
Public subnet - have access to internet - AWS - Route tables - acts as internet gateway

whenever we create a subnet you will be asked to provide a CIDR range (Cider)
CIDR: Way of explaining how many IP addresses are available in a particular subnet.
