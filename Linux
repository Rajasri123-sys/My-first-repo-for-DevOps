IP Address
Used to generate unique address to a particular device that is connected to your network.
To generate IP Address, standard we used is IPv4
Dot(.) - each of them vary from 0 to 255.
0-255*0-255*0-255*0-255
why 255 - computer understands bits.
IP Address - 4 bytes (32(4*8) bits)

________ | ________ | ________ | ________
   1          2         3         4

Ex: 172.32.16.1

Subnet:
dividing into separate sections and using
Advantage:
1. Security
2. Privacy
3. Isolation

Private subnet - does not have access to internet
Public subnet - have access to internet - AWS - Route tables - acts as internet gateway

whenever we create a subnet you will be asked to provide a CIDR range (Cider)
CIDR: Way of explaining how many IP addresses are available in a particular subnet.

When you create this particular subnet let's use AWS as an example.Create a subnet you need to go to the VPC first. Go to the subnet and within this subnet. while creating the subnet you will be asked for CIDR.

Ex: 172.16.3.0/24
24 bits remain constant, only last 8 bits varies.

172.16.0.0 --> 172.16.255.255   (256 IP address)

In a network when we create a VPC, it will initially ask for a range.
192.16.0.0/16 (65000 IP address)

I want subnet with 64 IP addresses
192.16.5.0/2 power 6  -> 32-26 2 power 6 = 64

192
172
10   - These are private subnet.

Google - 8.8.8.8

PORTS:
Port is a unique number for your application.
Whenever we create IP addresses to connect to websites we provide some ports.
In an instance there can be hundreds of application and using port you can distinguish the request has to go to which particular application.
Whenever you create application on a virtual machine. To access this application from the internet you need two things. One is the IP address of this virtual machine.
